### ABSTRACT
We present the La Mobilière insurance customers dataset: a 12-year-long longitudinal collection of data on policies ofcustomers of the Swiss insurance company La Mobilière. 
To preserve the privacy of La Mobilière customers, we propose thedata aggregated at two geographical levels, based on the place of residence of the customer: postal areas and municipalities.
For each geographical area, the data provides summary statistics on: i) the demographic characteristics of the customer base,ii) characteristics of vehicles insurance policies and iii) characteristics of housing and building insurance policies. 
To assess thevalidity of the data, we investigate the temporal consistency of the data and the representativeness of La Mobilière customerbase along several dimensions (total population, percentage of foreigners, etc.). We also show how the insurance data canreliably model the spatial patterns of socio-economic indicators at a high-geographical resolution. 
We believe that the reuse ofthis data provides an opportunity for researchers to broaden the socio-economic characterization of Swiss areas beyond theuse of official data sources.
